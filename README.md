### by Fern. H.W. (@fern_hw, fernhw.com)
* Create random trees in unity!<br/>
* pretty much<br/>

While tools like speed tree are useful they don't match all art-styles and have a lot of unnecesary fluff, this might be right for you as it might not be.<br/>


## What it needs, what can you do?
Work in Progress

* I still havent figured out how to use unity's native LOD system with procedural meshes.
* I want to do something about the stage wanting to save all the geometry
* Needs UVS
* Needs Leaf generation
* Textures to work these things in.
* Generate even more plant life, and even effects in the future.
